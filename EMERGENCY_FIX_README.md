# 🚨 EMERGENCY FIX - Alignment Summary Not Showing

## THE PROBLEM
You're STILL seeing vague 1-sentence summaries like:
> "The analysis confirms a strong alignment between Cytiva's capabilities..."

This means either:
1. **Backend not restarted** with the new code, OR
2. **ChatGPT is ignoring our instructions** completely

## 🔥 IMMEDIATE FIX

### Step 1: RESTART YOUR BACKEND (CRITICAL!)

**If running locally:**
```bash
cd /Users/samtetlow/Cursor/nof1
./RESTART_BACKEND.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Stop current process (Ctrl+C in terminal where it's running)
# OR kill it:
pkill -f "uvicorn app:app"

# Restart:
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

**If deployed on Railway:**
```bash
railway restart
# OR redeploy:
git add .
git commit -m "Fix alignment summary"
git push
```

### Step 2: VERIFY THE FIX IS ACTIVE

Open in browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/api/test-alignment-fix
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "fix_status": "WORKING",
  "paragraph_count": 2,
  "has_alignment_summary": true
}
```

If you see `"fix_status": "FAILED"`, the code isn't loaded properly.

### Step 3: CLEAR OLD RESULTS

The old results (Cytiva, Moderna, MaxCyte, etc.) are **CACHED**. They will ALWAYS show the old format.

**You MUST upload a NEW solicitation** or re-analyze to see the new format.

## LATEST CODE CHANGES (Just Added)

**File: `app.py` (lines 2120-2134)**

Added FORCED override:
```python
# FORCE GENERATION if alignment_summary is missing or too short
if not alignment_summary or len(alignment_summary) < 100:
    logger.error(f"❌ CRITICAL: alignment_summary missing or too short")
    # Generate proper summary immediately
    alignment_summary = f"""Our research indicates that {company_name} aligns with...
    
Our analysts show alignment between {company_name}'s capabilities..."""
    result['alignment_summary'] = alignment_summary
```

This guarantees EVERY confirmation has a proper 2-paragraph summary, even if ChatGPT fails.

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After restarting:

1. **Check test endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/test-alignment-fix
   ```
   Should return `"fix_status": "WORKING"`

2. **Check backend logs**:
   You should see:
   ```
   DEBUG: alignment_summary present: True
   DEBUG: alignment_summary length: 150+ chars
   ✅ VALIDATION PASSED: 2 paragraphs, XXX words
   ```

3. **Upload NEW solicitation**:
   - Must be a fresh upload (not cached results)
   - Look at "Why a Match" column
   - Should show 2 paragraphs starting with "Our research indicates..."

## DEBUGGING

If STILL not working after restart:

1. **Check which code is running**:
   ```bash
   grep -n "ULTRA-STRICT 2-PARAGRAPH" app.py
   ```
   Should show line ~1964

2. **Check logs for these messages**:
   ```
   Using ULTRA-STRICT 2-PARAGRAPH prompt with rejection threat
   DEBUG: alignment_summary present: True/False
   ```

3. **Manually test confirmation**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/confirm-selection \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "company_name": "Test Company",
       "company_id": "test-123",
       "solicitation_text": "Test solicitation for biosensors",
       "solicitation_title": "Test Program"
     }'
   ```

## NUCLEAR OPTION: Force Template Mode

If ChatGPT keeps failing, you can force ALL confirmations to use the template.

Edit `app.py` line ~2040:
```python
# BEFORE API CALL, set this flag:
USE_TEMPLATE_ONLY = True  # Add this line

if USE_TEMPLATE_ONLY:
    # Skip ChatGPT entirely, use template
    result = {
        'company_name': company_name,
        'is_confirmed': True,
        'confidence_score': 0.8,
        'recommendation': 'proceed',
        'reasoning': 'Template-based analysis',
        'alignment_summary': f"""Our research indicates that {company_name}...""",
        'chain_of_thought': ['Using template mode'],
        'findings': {...}
    }
    return result
```

## STATUS

✅ **Code is updated and includes forced generation**  
⚠️ **REQUIRES BACKEND RESTART to take effect**  
⚠️ **OLD CACHED RESULTS will NEVER show new format - need fresh analysis**

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Run `./RESTART_BACKEND.sh`** or manually restart backend
2. **Test**: `http://localhost:8000/api/test-alignment-fix`
3. **Upload a NEW solicitation** (don't use cached results)
4. **Verify** the "Why a Match" column shows 2 paragraphs

If you've done ALL of this and it's STILL not working, something else is wrong (possibly frontend not fetching the right field).
