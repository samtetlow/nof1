# ðŸš‚ DEPLOY ALIGNMENT FIX TO RAILWAY

## THE PROBLEM

Your frontend is pointing to Railway:
```
https://web-production-978ba.up.railway.app
```

But all our fixes have only been applied to your LOCAL backend. Railway is still running the OLD code!

## ðŸš€ DEPLOY TO RAILWAY NOW

### Step 1: Commit the Changes
```bash
cd /Users/samtetlow/Cursor/nof1

# Add all changes
git add app.py

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "Fix alignment summary - force 2-paragraph format at all levels"
```

### Step 2: Push to Railway
```bash
# Push to main/master branch (Railway watches this)
git push origin main
# OR if your branch is master:
git push origin master
```

### Step 3: Wait for Railway to Deploy
- Railway will automatically detect the push
- It will rebuild and redeploy
- This takes 2-5 minutes
- Watch the Railway dashboard for deployment status

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
Once deployed, test the Railway backend:
```bash
curl https://web-production-978ba.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### Step 5: Test Alignment Fix on Railway
```bash
curl https://web-production-978ba.up.railway.app/api/test-alignment-fix
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "fix_status": "WORKING",
  "paragraph_count": 2
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ THEN Test in Your Application

1. **Clear your browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Upload a NEW solicitation** (not one you've analyzed before)
3. **Run the analysis**
4. **Check "Why a Match"** - should now show 2 paragraphs

## Alternative: Railway CLI

If you have Railway CLI installed:
```bash
railway up
```

Or restart the service:
```bash
railway restart
```

## Quick Deploy Script

Run this to deploy everything:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /Users/samtetlow/Cursor/nof1

echo "ðŸ“¦ Adding changes..."
git add app.py

echo "ðŸ’¾ Committing..."
git commit -m "Fix alignment summary - triple-layer safety net for 2-paragraph format"

echo "ðŸš€ Pushing to Railway..."
git push origin main

echo "âœ… Deployed! Wait 2-3 minutes for Railway to rebuild."
echo ""
echo "Test at: https://web-production-978ba.up.railway.app/health"
```

## Why This Matters

**Your setup:**
- Frontend (Vercel) â†’ Calls Railway API
- Railway backend â†’ OLD code (pre-fix)
- Local backend â†’ NEW code (with fixes) âœ…

**Until you deploy to Railway, your frontend will keep getting old results!**

**Next Steps:**
1. Run the commands above to deploy to Railway
2. Wait 2-3 minutes
3. Upload fresh solicitation
4. Should work!
