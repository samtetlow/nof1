- `.coveragerc` - Coverage reporting configuration

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Theme extraction tests (problem areas, capabilities, keywords)
- ✅ API endpoint tests (health checks, upload, pipeline)
- ✅ Error handling tests
- ✅ 80% coverage requirement enforced

### ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipelines (100% Complete)
Automated workflows for continuous integration and deployment:

**Workflows Created:**
1. **`backend-ci.yml`** - Backend Testing & Quality
   - Runs on every push to `main` and `n-of-1-production`
   - Tests on Python 3.11 & 3.12
   - Automated linting (flake8)
   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Security scanning (Bandit)
   - Coverage enforcement (80% minimum)
   - Uploads coverage to Codecov

2. **`frontend-ci.yml`** - Frontend Testing & Quality
   - Runs on every push
   - Tests on Node 18.x & 20.x
   - TypeScript type checking
   - ESLint linting
   - Build verification
   - Lighthouse performance audits

3. **`deploy-staging.yml`** - Auto-Deploy to Staging
   - Triggers on push to `n-of-1-production`
   - Deploys backend to Railway (staging)
   - Deploys frontend to Vercel (staging)
   - Runs health checks
   - Executes smoke tests

4. **`deploy-production.yml`** - Manual Production Deployment
   - Requires manual trigger
   - Requires typing "deploy" for confirmation
   - Version-controlled deployments
   - Health checks before and after
   - Automated rollback on failure

5. **`dependency-update.yml`** - Weekly Dependency Updates
   - Runs every Monday at 9 AM UTC
   - Checks Python and npm dependencies
   - Creates PRs automatically
   - You just review and merge

### ✅ Helper Scripts (100% Complete)
Convenient scripts for local development:

**Scripts Created:**
- `scripts/run_tests.sh` - Run all tests with coverage reporting
- `scripts/check_coverage.sh` - Verify 80% coverage threshold
- `scripts/rollback.sh` - Quick rollback to previous version

### ✅ Dependencies Updated
Added to `requirements.txt`:
- `pytest==7.4.3` - Test framework
- `pytest-cov==4.1.0` - Coverage plugin
- `pytest-asyncio==0.21.1` - Async test support
- `pytest-mock==3.12.0` - Mocking utilities
- `coverage==7.3.2` - Coverage reporting

### ✅ Documentation (100% Complete)
- `CI_CD_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- `PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md` - This summary document

## 🚀 What Happens Now (Fully Automated!)

### On Every Code Push:
1. ✅ **Automatic testing** - All tests run on Python 3.11 & 3.12
2. ✅ **Code quality checks** - Linting, type checking, security scans
3. ✅ **Coverage enforcement** - Must maintain 80% or PR is blocked
4. ✅ **Build verification** - Frontend builds successfully

### On Push to `n-of-1-production`:
1. ✅ **All CI checks pass** (tests, linting, coverage)
2. ✅ **Auto-deploy to staging** environment
3. ✅ **Health checks** verify deployment
4. ✅ **Smoke tests** confirm functionality

### Every Monday:
1. ✅ **Check for dependency updates**
2. ✅ **Create PR with updates**
3. 👤 **You review and merge** (~2 minutes)

### Production Deployments:
1. 👤 **Go to GitHub Actions**
2. 👤 **Click "Deploy to Production"**
3. 👤 **Enter version and confirm** (~30 seconds)
4. ✅ **Everything else is automatic**

## 📋 Next Steps for You

### One-Time Setup (15 minutes total):

1. **Add GitHub Secrets** (10 minutes)
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add these secrets:
     ```
     RAILWAY_TOKEN
     RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID
     VERCEL_TOKEN
     VERCEL_ORG_ID
     VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
     OPENAI_API_KEY
     STAGING_BACKEND_URL
     STAGING_FRONTEND_URL
     PRODUCTION_BACKEND_URL
     PRODUCTION_FRONTEND_URL
     ```

2. **Install Test Dependencies Locally** (2 minutes)
   ```bash
   cd /Users/samtetlow/Cursor/nof1
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Tests Locally to Verify** (3 minutes)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_tests.sh
   ```

### Ongoing Work (10 minutes per week):

**Weekly:**
