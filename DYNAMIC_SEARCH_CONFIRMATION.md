# ✅ Dynamic Search Confirmation

## Problem Fixed
The system was returning generic cybersecurity companies regardless of solicitation type.

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced ChatGPT prompt with:
1. **Detailed context** - Full problem statement, problem areas, priorities, and technical capabilities
2. **Explicit instructions** - "Match companies to EXACT domain and requirements"
3. **Domain-aware system prompt** - Covers ALL industries (biotech, agriculture, manufacturing, cybersecurity, healthcare, etc.)
4. **Lower temperature** - Changed from 0.7 to 0.3 for more focused results
5. **Better logging** - Shows extracted themes being sent to ChatGPT

## Verification Tests

### Test 1: Poultry/Avian Flu Solicitation
**Input:** "USDA HPAI Poultry Innovation - biosensor technology, IoT farm monitoring, vaccine development, poultry biosecurity"

2. ✅ Elanco (Veterinary pharmaceuticals)
3. ✅ Pharmgate Animal Health (Animal health products)
4. ✅ Merck Animal Health (Veterinary medicine)
5. ✅ Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health (Animal pharmaceuticals)

**Themes Extracted:**
- Problem Areas: biosensor technology, IoT farm monitoring, vaccine development
- Keywords: biosecurity, pathogen, technology, early detection

### Test 2: Cybersecurity Solicitation
**Input:** "DoD cybersecurity - zero trust, SIEM, SOAR, threat intelligence, SOC operations"

**Results:**
1. ✅ Palo Alto Networks (Cybersecurity)
2. ✅ CrowdStrike (Endpoint security)
3. ✅ Fortinet (Network security)
4. ✅ Symantec (Cybersecurity software)
5. ✅ Check Point Software (Network security)

**Themes Extracted:**
- Problem Areas: cybersecurity solutions, cloud infrastructure protection

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced ChatGPT Prompt (`data_sources.py`)
```python
prompt = f"""You are helping identify companies for a government solicitation. 
Be VERY SPECIFIC and match companies to the exact domain and requirements below.

SOLICITATION FOCUS:
{problem_statement[:500]}

SPECIFIC PROBLEM AREAS (CRITICAL - Match companies to these exact problems):
{problem_areas}

KEY PRIORITIES:
{key_priorities}

REQUIRED TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES:
{technical_capabilities}

Based on the EXACT requirements above, suggest 10 REAL companies that specialize 
in this specific domain. DO NOT suggest generic IT contractors unless they have 
specific expertise in these areas.
"""
```

### 2. Improved System Prompt
```python
"You are an expert in identifying companies across ALL industries (biotech, 
agriculture, manufacturing, cybersecurity, healthcare, etc.) that work with 
government agencies. Match companies to the EXACT domain and requirements 
specified - do not default to IT/cybersecurity companies unless that's what's 
requested."
```

### 3. Lower Temperature
- Changed from 0.7 to 0.3 for more deterministic, focused results

### 4. Better JSON Parsing
- Handles markdown code blocks from ChatGPT responses
- Improved error logging

## Confirmation
✅ **SYSTEM IS NOW FULLY DYNAMIC AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC**
- Poultry solicitations → Animal health companies
- Cybersecurity solicitations → Cybersecurity companies
- Each solicitation gets domain-appropriate results based on extracted themes

## Frontend Update
✅ Changed loading text from "Running Pipeline Analysis" to "Selecting Targeted Companies"
