# Theme-Based Company Search Implementation

## Summary of Changes

The platform has been updated to **dynamically search for companies** using the solicitation's extracted themes instead of relying on pre-seeded database companies.

---

## What Changed

### 1. **Removed Seed Data**
- ❌ Deleted 3 hardcoded companies:
  - Aegis Cyber Solutions
  - Atlas Systems Integration  
  - Helio Bioinformatics
- ✅ Companies are now discovered via theme-based search from external APIs

### 2. **Full Pipeline Now Uses Theme Search**
**Before:**
```python
companies = db.query(CompanyORM).all()  # Static database lookup
```

**After:**
```python
# Extract themes from solicitation
themes = analyze_solicitation_themes(solicitation.raw_text)

# Search external APIs (Google, Pitchbook, USASpending, etc.)
search_results = await theme_search.search_by_themes(themes, max_results=top_k * 3)

# Convert to company objects for matching
companies = [convert_search_result_to_company(result) for result in search_results]
```

### 3. **Frontend Button Updated**
- ❌ Old: "Run Full Pipeline Analysis"
- ✅ New: "Search for Targeted Companies"
- Loading state: "Searching..." (instead of "Analyzing...")

### 4. **Pipeline Flow Updated**
**New Flow:**
1. **Extract Themes** → Analyze solicitation for problems, goals, and capabilities
2. **Search Companies** → Query external APIs using themes as search criteria
3. **Match** → Score discovered companies against solicitation
4. **Enrich** → Gather additional data from APIs
5. **Confirm** → Verify alignment with external sources
6. **Validate** → Risk assessment and SWOT analysis

## How Theme Search Works

### Theme Extraction
The platform extracts:
- **Problem Statement**: Core challenge to solve
- **Problem Areas**: Specific pain points (highest priority)
- **Program Goals**: Milestones and measurable outcomes
- **Key Priorities**: Must-have requirements
- **Technical Capabilities**: Skills needed (weighted by context)
- **Search Keywords**: Intelligent keywords derived from problems + capabilities

### Company Discovery
Searches across multiple data sources:
- **Google Custom Search**: General company discovery
- **Pitchbook API**: Startups and funding data
- **USASpending.gov**: Government contractors
- **NIH Reporter**: Biomedical/research companies
- **SBIR.gov**: Small business innovators

### Relevance Scoring
Companies are scored by:
- Match to problem areas
- Technical capability alignment
- Contextual relevance (not just keyword frequency)
- Recent activity/contracts in similar areas

---

## Benefits

✅ **Dynamic Discovery**: Finds companies specific to each solicitation
✅ **No Manual Database**: No need to pre-populate companies
✅ **Broader Coverage**: Searches across multiple authoritative sources
✅ **Problem-Focused**: Prioritizes companies that solve the stated problems
✅ **Always Up-to-Date**: Queries live APIs for current information

## Testing

Upload a solicitation and click **"Search for Targeted Companies"**

The platform will:
1. Extract themes from your solicitation
2. Search external APIs for matching companies
3. Display the most relevant companies with scores

**Note**: API keys are required in `config.json` for full functionality. Without API keys, the system will log warnings but continue with mock data for testing.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `app.py`: 
  - Updated `full_pipeline` endpoint to use theme search
  - Removed `SEED` data
  - Updated seed endpoint to return info message
- `frontend/src/components/SolicitationForm.tsx`:
  - Changed button text to "Search for Targeted Companies"
- `nof1.db`: Deleted (will be recreated without seed data)

### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/full-pipeline
```
Now performs:
1. Theme extraction
2. External API search
3. Company matching
4. Enrichment, confirmation, validation

### Fallback Behavior
If theme search returns no results:
- System logs warning
- Falls back to any existing database companies
- Continues with pipeline processing
