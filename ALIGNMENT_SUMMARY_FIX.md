# Alignment Summary Format Fix

## Issue Identified
The `alignment_summary` field in confirmation results was returning **vague, single-sentence summaries** instead of the required **2-paragraph detailed analysis**.

### Example of Bad Output (Before Fix):
```
"The detailed analysis confirms a strong alignment between Cytiva's capabilities and the solicitation requirements, supported by their track record and key strengths."
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Only 1 sentence (not 2 paragraphs)
- ❌ Generic/vague (no specific details)
- ❌ Missing program reference
- ❌ Missing mission connection
- ❌ Missing technical capabilities
- ❌ Not client-facing professional language

## Required Output Format

The `alignment_summary` **MUST** be exactly **2 paragraphs** with this structure:

### Paragraph 1 (80-120 words) - Program Reference & Mission Connection
- Agency name and program/solicitation title
- Agency's broader mission and strategic priorities
- Company specialization and market position
- How company supports agency's goals
- Company's expertise and operational capacity

### Paragraph 2 (80-120 words) - Scope Alignment & Technical Fit
- Alignment between company's technology/services and solicitation needs
- **3 specific key capabilities** that address requirements
- Methodologies/technologies used to deliver outcomes
- (Optional) Evidence of readiness (TRL/IRL, pilots, prototypes - only if publicly available)
- Proven experience demonstrating readiness

### Example of Good Output (After Fix):
```
Our research indicates that Cytiva aligns with USDA's Poultry Disease Surveillance Enhancement Program. This opportunity directly connects to USDA's broader mission of protecting agricultural health and biosecurity infrastructure, with current strategic priorities in rapid pathogen detection and avian disease prevention. Cytiva specializes in bioprocessing solutions and advanced diagnostic technologies, having established itself as a global leader in life sciences instrumentation. Their focus on rapid testing platforms and biosensor development positions them to support USDA's goals of early disease detection and outbreak prevention capabilities.

Our analysts show strong alignment between Cytiva's diagnostic technology portfolio and the solicitation's stated need for automated pathogen detection systems. Their key capabilities include microfluidic biosensor platforms, AI-powered diagnostic analytics, and cold-chain sample management solutions, which directly address the program's requirements for field-deployable testing. Cytiva utilizes advanced immunoassay technology and real-time PCR detection methods to deliver results within 2-4 hours, making them well-suited to execute rapid surveillance operations. The company's proven experience in veterinary diagnostics and USDA contract performance demonstrates their readiness to meet the program requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Strengthened Prompt (Lines 1965-2029)
- Added visual separators (━━━) to emphasize critical requirements
- Included concrete example of correct output format
- Added validation checklist within the prompt
- Included failure example with explanation of what's wrong
- More explicit instructions with "DO NOT write a single sentence"

### 2. Updated API Call Parameters (Lines 2031-2039)
- **Increased `max_tokens`**: 1500 → 2000 (to accommodate 2 full paragraphs)
- **Lowered `temperature`**: 0.6 → 0.3 (for more consistent formatting, less creativity)
- **Strengthened system prompt**: More explicit about the 2-paragraph requirement

### 3. Added Validation Logic (Lines 2056-2086)
- Counts actual paragraphs in the response
- Validates word count (expects 160-240 words total)
- Checks for required opening phrases:
  - Paragraph 1: "Our research indicates that..."
  - Paragraph 2: "Our analysts show strong alignment between..."
- Logs detailed validation results:
  - ✅ **PASSED**: Correct format detected
  - ⚠️ **WARNING**: Format issue detected (still usable)
  - ❌ **FAILED**: Serious format violation

### 4. Logging Improvements
- Logs validation status for every confirmation
- Shows word count and paragraph count
- Displays first 200 characters if validation fails
- Helps debug and monitor prompt effectiveness

## Testing Instructions

1. **Deploy the updated code**
2. **Run a solicitation analysis** with company confirmation
3. **Check server logs** for validation messages:
   ```
   ✅ VALIDATION PASSED: 2 paragraphs, 187 words, correct format
   ```
4. **Review the alignment_summary** in the frontend - should see 2 detailed paragraphs

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- Single vague sentence
- No specific details about agency, program, or capabilities
- Not useful for client presentation

### After Fix
- **2 complete paragraphs** (160-240 words total)
- **Specific details**: agency name, program, mission, strategic priorities
- **3 key capabilities** explicitly listed
- **Professional analyst language**: "Our research indicates...", "Our analysts show..."
- **Client-ready** executive summary format

## Validation Checklist

When reviewing confirmation results, verify:
- [ ] Contains exactly 2 paragraphs
- [ ] Paragraph 1 starts with "Our research indicates that [Company] aligns with [Agency]'s..."
- [ ] Paragraph 1 mentions agency mission and strategic priorities
- [ ] Paragraph 2 starts with "Our analysts show strong alignment between..."
- [ ] Paragraph 2 lists 3 specific capabilities
- [ ] Total word count: 160-240 words
- [ ] Language is professional, specific, and concrete (not vague)

## Rollback Plan

If this change causes issues:
1. Revert `app.py` lines 1963-2086 to previous version
2. Previous prompt used `max_tokens=1500` and `temperature=0.6`
3. Backup available in git history
