## ðŸ”§ How It Works

When you upload a solicitation:

1. **Theme Extraction** - Platform analyzes the solicitation for:
   - Problem areas
   - Key priorities
   - Technical capabilities needed

2. **ChatGPT Analysis** - Sends themes to OpenAI GPT-4 with prompt:
   ```
   "Based on this government solicitation analysis, suggest 10 real 
   companies that would be excellent matches..."
   ```

3. **Intelligent Matching** - GPT-4 returns:
   - Real government contractors
   - Companies with relevant experience
   - Detailed match reasoning
   - Contact information

## ðŸ“Š Example Response

For a cybersecurity solicitation, ChatGPT might return:

```json
{
  "name": "Booz Allen Hamilton",
  "description": "Leading government contractor specializing in cybersecurity...",
  "match_reason": "Extensive DoD cybersecurity experience with cloud infrastructure...",
  "website": "https://www.boozallen.com",
  "capabilities": ["Cloud Security", "Zero Trust", "Threat Intelligence"]
}
```

## ðŸš€ Testing

- âœ… Real company names (not generic "Company #1")
- âœ… Detailed descriptions
- âœ… Professional match reasoning
- âœ… Actual websites
- âœ… Relevant capabilities

## ðŸ”‘ API Key

```json
{
  "chatgpt": {
    "api_key": "sk-proj-...",
    "model": "gpt-4"
  }
}
```

## ðŸ’° Cost Note

Each solicitation analysis makes 1 API call to GPT-4:
- ~500-1000 tokens per request
- Cost: ~$0.01-0.03 per solicitation
- Much more accurate than web scraping
