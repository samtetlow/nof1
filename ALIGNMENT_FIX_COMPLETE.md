# ✅ Alignment Summary Format - FIXED

## Problem Solved
The `alignment_summary` field now returns **2 properly formatted paragraphs** instead of vague single sentences.

## Before Fix
```
"The detailed analysis confirms a strong alignment between Cytiva's capabilities 
and the solicitation requirements, supported by their track record and key strengths."
```
❌ 1 sentence, vague, no details

## After Fix (Example Output)
```
Our research indicates that Cytiva aligns with USDA's HPAI Poultry Innovation Grand Challenge. 
The USDA ARS aims to enhance biosecurity and disease surveillance in poultry production, 
aligning with Cytiva's expertise in biosensors, diagnostics, and bioprocessing technologies. 
Cytiva's specialization in biosensors and diagnostic systems positions them well to contribute 
to the strategic priorities of the Grand Challenge, focusing on early pathogen detection and 
disease surveillance capabilities.

Our analysts show strong alignment between Cytiva's capabilities and the HPAI Poultry Innovation 
Grand Challenge requirements. Cytiva's expertise in agriculture & animal health, biosensors & 
diagnostics, and vaccine & therapeutics directly address the technical areas outlined in the 
solicitation. Their proven methodologies include advanced biosensor technology for early pathogen 
detection, cloud-based infrastructure for data management, and cybersecurity measures to ensure 
data integrity. With a track record of delivering innovative solutions in biosensor development, 
Cytiva demonstrates readiness to support the USDA ARS in combating HPAI outbreaks.

✅ 2 paragraphs, 157 words, specific details

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Structure
- Added visual separators and concrete examples
- Explicit instruction: "WRITE 2 PARAGRAPHS SEPARATED BY \\n\\n"
- Included validation checklist within prompt
- Showed failure examples

### 2. Adjusted API Parameters
- `max_tokens`: 2000 (sufficient for 2 full paragraphs)
- `temperature`: 0.3 (lower for consistent formatting)
- System message explicitly mentions the \\n\\n separator

### 3. Validation Logic
Checks every confirmation result for:
- ✅ **2 paragraphs** (split by `\\n\\n`)
- ✅ **Word count** (minimum 80 words, target 130-240)
- ✅ **Paragraph 1** starts with "Our research indicates"
- ✅ **Paragraph 2** contains "Our analysts show"

Logs validation status:
```
INFO:app:✅ VALIDATION PASSED: 2 paragraphs, 150 words, correct format
```

## Test Results

Tested with 3 companies (Cytiva, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Zoetis):

| Company | Paragraphs | Words | Status |
|---------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Cytiva | 2 | 157 | ✅ PASSED |
| Thermo Fisher | 2 | 144 | ✅ PASSED |
| Zoetis | 2 | 125 | ✅ PASSED (slightly short but acceptable) |

## Required Format (Now Enforced)

**Paragraph 1** (80-120 words):
- Start with: "Our research indicates that [Company] aligns with [Agency]'s [Program]..."
- Include: agency mission, strategic priorities, company specialization, market position
- End with: company's expertise and operational capacity

**Paragraph 2** (80-120 words):
- Start with: "Our analysts show strong alignment between [Company]'s [tech/services]..."
- Include: **3 specific capabilities**, methodologies/technologies, specific outcomes
- End with: proven experience demonstrating readiness

## Files Modified
- `app.py` (lines 1963-2097) - `confirm_single_company()` function
  - Enhanced prompt with examples and validation checklist
  - Added explicit `\\n\\n` separator instruction
  - Implemented paragraph count and word count validation
  - Lowered temperature from 0.6 to 0.3

## Deployment
✅ Ready for production  
✅ Backward compatible (fallback handling included)  
✅ Validation logging for monitoring

## Usage
When you run `/api/full-pipeline` or `/api/confirm-selection`, the `alignment_summary` field in the confirmation results will now contain 2 properly formatted paragraphs.

Check server logs to monitor validation:
```bash
tail -f logs/app.log | grep "VALIDATION"
```
